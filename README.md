## Background

Sentiment analysis aims to provide insights into customer sentiment towards a brand by analyzing text data for positive or negative sentiment. This information can help businesses improve customer relationships, enhance loyalty, and refine customer service.

Topic modeling, on the other hand, discovers abstract topics within a collection of documents by identifying frequently used words or phrases and grouping them. This helps businesses understand customer concerns, interests, and preferences.

The goal of this assignment is to perform sentiment analysis and topic modelling on review texts from eCommerce shopping platforms.
